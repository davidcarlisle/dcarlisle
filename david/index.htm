<h2>LaTeX</h2>

<p>
For several years I have been a member of the <b>LaTeX3</b> project,
which has been responsible for the design and maintenance of the current
standard <b><a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></b> system.
</p>

<h2>NAG</h2>

<p>
Since February 1998 I have been working at <a
href="http://www.nag.co.uk">NAG</a>.
Originally on the Esprit <a href="http://www.openmath.org">
OpenMath</a> project, and since then on various other European
and in-house projects related to the processing and specification of mathematical documents and services. I'm currently a Principal Technical Consulant and Group Leader of the XML Technologies group. I also have a small <a href="http://www.nag.co.uk/about/dcarlisle.asp">Home Page at NAG</a>.
</p>

<h2>OpenMath</h2>
<p>I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.openmath.org/society/">OpenMath Society</a> and an editor of the <a href="http://www.openmath.org/standard">OpenMath Standard</a>.
</p>

<h2>MathML</h2>
<p>I have been an Invited Expert in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math">W3C Math Working Group</a> (or Interest Group) since 1998 (shortly after the first release of MathML 1.0). I'm an editor of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/">MathML 2</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/">MathML 3</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-entity-names/">XML Entity Definitions for Characters</a> Recommendations.</p>

<h2>XSLT and XQuery</h2>
<p>I'm a regular contributor to the <a href="http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list">XSL-list</a> and I've also been a regular commenter on XQuery, and have a slightly idiosyncratic XQuery implementation, <a href="http://monet.nag.co.uk/xq2xml">xq2xml</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://dpcarlisle.blogspot.com/">Blog</a></h2>
<p>A somewhat experimental blog over at <a href="http://dpcarlisle.blogspot.com/">blogger</a>.</p>

<h2>F0FS</h2>
<p>I'm currently experimenting with <a href="http://sites.google.com">Google Sites</a> for the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/friendsoffritwellschool/">Parent Teacher Association</a> of Matthew's school.</p>
